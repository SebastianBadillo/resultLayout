## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I review a lot of things about flex-box and grid, I also learned how to make an adaptative circle, how to make gradients,
how to fade colors, etc

```html

```

```css
.circle {
  margin: 0 auto;

  width: 50%; /* Adjust the width and height as per your requirements */
  height: 0;
  padding-bottom: 50%; /* Creates a square based on the width */
  background-image: linear-gradient(
    to bottom,
    var(--LightRoyalBlue),
    var(--LightSlateBlue)
  ); /* Replace with your desired background color */
  border-radius: 50%;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;

  align-items: center;
}
.result {
  background-image: linear-gradient(
    to bottom,
    var(--LightSlateBlue),
    var(--LightRoyalBlue)
  );
  border-radius: 1rem;
}
```

```

```

### Continued development

- I have to improve the way in which I adjust positions with fles and grid

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://chat.openai.com/) - this helped me with the sytax I didnÂ´t know.
